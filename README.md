# Sentiment-Analysis-System
A machine learning-based system that analyzes text data and classifies sentiments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Built using Python and NLP libraries with an LSTM deep learning model.
##  Overview

This project analyzes the sentiment of textual input such as product reviews, tweets, or feedback using a trained LSTM model. It includes:
- Text preprocessing
- LSTM model training
- Evaluation
- Prediction interface


##  Features

✅ Supports three sentiment categories: Positive, Negative, Neutral  
✅ Preprocesses raw text using NLP techniques  
✅ Trains an LSTM model on labeled data  
✅ Accepts CSV dataset for training  
✅ Ready to integrate with UI or API


##  Dataset Format

The system uses a CSV file with the following structure:

csv
text,sentiment
"This product is amazing!",positive
"I hate this item.",negative
"It’s okay, not the best.",neutral
